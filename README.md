# Safeguarding-Bharat-s-EV-Charging-Networks-Through-OCPP-Protocol-Resilience-
We conduct the first India-focused study assessing security and privacy risks in Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) versions 1.6 and 2.0.1 within the countryâ€™s electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. Using a testbed simulating urban and rural scenarios, we identified critical vulnerabilities.
